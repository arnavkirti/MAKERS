# Decentralised To-Do App

Welcome to the Solidity React To-Do App repository! This project combines the power of Solidity for smart contract development, React for the frontend, and the ethers library for interacting with the contract. The Remix IDE was used for contract deployment, making it easy for users to run the app locally.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- Remix IDE for contract deployment

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
``
git clone https://github.com/arnavkirti/To-Do-Decentralised-App.git
``
 
1. Change into the client directory:
``
cd client
``

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
``
npm install
``

The app will be accessible locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Technologies Used
Solidity: Used for writing the smart contract logic.
React: Used for building the user interface.
Ethers Library: Used for interacting with the smart contract.
JavaScript: Used for all logic and scripting.
Remix IDE: Used for smart contract development and deployment.

# Folder Structure
server/: Contains the Solidity smart contract files and all the backend logic built on Ethereum Blockchain.
client/: Contains the React frontend files.

# Smart Contract Deployment
The smart contract was deployed using Remix IDE. You can find the deployed contract on the Ethereum blockchain at 0x51b7eC6E0304Bcb5C5164a00D0c72eB67d9DceE7.
